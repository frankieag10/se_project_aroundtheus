# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
This project I learned how to make adjustments to screen sizes on 320 view port for phones,tablets and diffrernt sized monitors.
